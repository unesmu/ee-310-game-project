# ee-310-worlds-hardest-game
Code for my personal project in ee-310 micro embedded systems at EPFL. It is a video game that is heavily inspired from "world's hardest game from the website https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-worlds-hardest-game (Beware there are a lot of advertisements on the website) ). This was coded entirely in C++ and runs on a nintento DS console.
