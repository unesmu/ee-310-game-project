# Microprogrammed Embedded Systems (EE-310) project

## Description
Code for my personal project in micro embedded systems at EPFL (EE-310). It is a video game that is heavily inspired from "world's hardest game from the website [coolmathgames](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-worlds-hardest-game) (Beware there is a considerable amount of advertisements on the website). This was coded in C and runs on a nintento DS console.

## How to run

Unfortunately the virtual machine and environment required to run the game are not publicly available (due to licensing matters), so I can not provide them here, but you can contact me at younes.moussaif@epfl.ch if you want to see a demo or if you want to know more about this project.
